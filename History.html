        <p>  In November 1974, Ronald DeFeo Jr. brutally murdered six members of his family while they were asleep in
             the Amityville house. A year later, in December 1975, George and Kathy Lutz, along with Kathy's three 
             children, moved into the residence, purchasing it at a discounted price due to its infamous past. Soon 
             after settling in, the Lutz family claimed to have encountered a series of disturbing paranormal phenomena.
             They reported hearing strange sounds, witnessing moving objects, experiencing foul odors, and even 
             encountering unseen entities. These alleged haunting experiences became the basis for a bestselling
             book titled "The Amityville Horror," written by Jay Anson and published in 1977. The book was later
             adapted into a popular film series, further cementing the house's place in popular culture. 
             Despite ongoing debates about the veracity of the events, the Amityville Horror House remains 
             an iconic and infamous location in paranormal lore.
